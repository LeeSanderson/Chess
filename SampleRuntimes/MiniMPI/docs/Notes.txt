Egar flag - indicates to tell the MPI runtime to automatically mark the S as completed (this would be like the MPI runtime on the sender has buffered it). otherwise, the S is only completed when the corresponding R has finished (i.e. so the seneder's runtime has someplace to send the data).

W - blocks until the C state for the handle has been marked (whether via eager or actual matched R finishes).

B - 



In rules syntax, a blocking call is where the PC (l) is not incremented by that rule.
e.g. Pw, Pb do not increment PC, only add the instruction. When it's completed, is when the PC will be allowed to increment and move to the next instruction.


Px rules are rules executed by a process.
Rx are rules for the runtime itself.



TODO:
The following tests, when run with race condition tests failed with the error:
	"Found store buffer vulnerability at RuntimeWorker..."
	SendRecvWaitTests.SendToSelf_WS_WR
	SendRecvWaitTests.etc - I didn't proceed with any of the other tests until I know what this error means.
