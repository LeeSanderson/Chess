    <h3>MpiProcess</h3>
    <p>SyncRoot - This object is used in lock statements for whenever the fields of the 
        process instance is being changed. Each process may only be modified by two 
        threads; namely, (1) The process thread itself and (2) the runtime thread. Due 
        to this, it&#39;s safe to expect that we can exit the lock w/o worrying about the 
        process from executing another Mpi API call. e.g. when in the MpiWait or 
        MpiBarrier calls.</p>
